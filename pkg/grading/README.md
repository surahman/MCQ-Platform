### None

Questions are not marked. This marking scheme does not grade the questions and allows them to be used as a questionnaire
or survey.

<br/>

### Binary

Questions are graded with an all or nothing policy.

- All correct answers must be selected to attain a mark on the question.
- Any incorrect answer selected will result in zero on the question.
- Questions that only have a single response in the answer key will generate an error if there is more than one answer
  in the response.

<br/>

### Negative

Negative marking allows for partial marks to be assigned for correct answers but deducts marks for any incorrect answer
options selected.

- Partial marks are awarded for every correct answer option selected with the formula
  `(1 / total number of correct options) * total number of correct options selected`
- Partial marks are deducted for every incorrect answer option selected with the formula
  `(1 / total number of incorrect options) * total number of incorrect options selected`
- Questions that only have a single response in the answer key will generate an error if there is more than one answer
  in the response.

### Non-negative

Non-negative marking allows for partial marks to be assigned for correct answers with no deductions for any incorrect answer
options that are selected.

- Partial marks are awarded for every correct answer option selected with the formula
  `(1 / total number of correct options) * total number of correct options selected`
- Questions that only have a single response in the answer key will generate an error if there is more than one answer
